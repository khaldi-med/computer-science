## Notes

* Content delivery networks (CDNs).
* What is CI/CD?
* Continuous integration is the process of completely automating code commit and test practices, thereby avoiding a manual workflow that is inefficient and subject to human error. 

* Newcomers to CI may be daunted by the potential error
risk associated with frequent code integration. However, CI actually reduces error risk. By integrating code with a common source on an ongoing basis, errors can immediately be isolated, avoiding time-consuming troubleshooting at a later stage.

* Continuous delivery goes further. CD is the process of automatically delivering code to a staging or production environment as soon as itâ€™s ready to ship. This allows you to deliver updates to your users faster, while creating a feedback loop for continual review and inspection. CD provides instant visibility into how a feature works in the production environment,
whether packages install correctly, and whether the delivery process is working as expected.

* According to Shaw and Garlan in Software Architecture: Perspectives on an Emerging
Discipline, (1996):
"The architecture of a software system defines that system in terms of computational components and interactions among those components."

* All architecture is design but not all design is architecture. Architecture
represents the significant design decisions that shape a system, where
significant is measured by cost of change.
