***
State definition with useState commonly follows this pattern:

const [stateValue, setStateValue] = useState(initialValue);

// adapted for our use case:
const [backgroundColor, setBackgroundColor] = useState(initialColor);

***
Hooks can only be called from the top level of a functional component.
Hooks canâ€™t be called from inside loops or conditions.
